<h3>A "Check Files" GUI</h3>
This graphical-user interface (GUI) allows a user to select a "from" directory and a "to" directory. Once selected, the program iterates through the "from" directory's file list, ascertains which files are within a day old (24 hours), and moves only those that qualify and are text (.txt) files. Built with Python and Tkinter for the GUI.
  
<h3>Phonebook</h3>
This graphical-user interface (GUI) allows a user to enter in details about a contact they'd like to add. The ability to add, update, and delete contacts is contained and functioning. Built with Python and Tkinter.

<h3>Checkbook Website</h3>
A mock website that allows several interactive functions to be completed on a checking/savings account. Constructed within the Django framework.
